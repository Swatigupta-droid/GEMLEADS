# GEMLEADS
GEMLEADS is built to help all those people who have difficulty keeping track of all the important leads/searches they have made for a topic which results 
in many open tabs all at once.

Using GemLeads they can keep track of all the leads by three ways: 

* Input the URL of the lead and save the input by clicking on Save Input.
* Save the URL of the active tab by clicking on Save This Tab. 
* Can download the saved URL into a text file by clicking on the download icon in the bottom right corner.
